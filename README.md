# Crime-Analytical-Dashboard
This is basically interactive data visualization of crime data of India. It is continuation of the project https://github.com/Vinay011221/Offense-Pattern-Analysis-based-on-Crimes-in-India . Dash Plotly framework is used to build this dashboard.
Data used is provided by NCRB (http://ncrb.gov.in/). 
Currently, Crimes Against women dataset is added(2001-15). 
Dashboard is provided with an Upload feature which will take dataset(in .xlsx or .csv) of next year/s and merge it with existing dataset.
DataFrame merging and interactive data visualizations are the basic feature. A small algorithm is embeded which predicts spike whether up or down for next year by analysing the pattern of spikes of recent top five years. 
Dashboard also shows correlation visualizations  between crimes.
